# Librarier - 图书馆儿

## Installation

Find the latest release [here](https://github.com/Gennadiyev/Librarier/releases/).

Note that only Android is currently supported, and there's no plan that iOS be supported.

## Building

Currently there is no way to build this app yourself **unless** you are part of the beta testing phase of FusionApp 2.0.

1. Install FusionApp 2.0 (Currently not published because it's in beta phase).

2. Download the source code and put it under the project folder (usually `/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/net.fusionapp/files/projects/`).

3. Open FusionApp 2.0, select the project, and click **Build**.
